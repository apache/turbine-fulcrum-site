    <section name="Binary And Source Distributions">
      <p>
        If you already know how to use Fulcrum and simply want the latest
        binaries or source, you can get them from the
        <a target="_blank" href="http://www.apache.org/dyn/closer.cgi/turbine/fulcrum">Apache Mirror System</a>.
      </p>
    </section>

    <section name="Building all Fulcrum components">
      <p>
        Building Fulcrum from SVN is now very easy because it has been
        Maven-enabled.  Before you begin, you'll need to check out the
        <code>turbine-fulcrum</code> SVN repository (if you are
        not familiar with the Apache SVN repositories, please refer to
        the <a href="http://apache.org/dev/version-control.html">documentation</a>).
        <source>
        svn checkout http://svn.apache.org/repos/asf/turbine/fulcrum/trunk/
        </source>
      </p>
    <h4>Maven 3 Build</h4>
      <p>
        Please refer to the Maven 3 <a
        href="http://maven.apache.org/guides/getting-started/">Getting
        Started</a> document for instructions on how to install and
        use Maven.
      </p>
      <p>
        From the root directory of the Fulcrum project (where you checked
        out the code to or unpacked a source distribution), simply run 
        <source>
        mvn install
        </source>
         This will start a process that will
        build each component.  After the component is built, it will be
        installed into you local maven repository. 
       </p>
      <p>
       To build a local copy of the documentation, use this: 
       <source>
        mvn site
        </source>
       This will build a local copy of the web site in the 'target/site' directory. 
       Note, this uses a LOT of memory. If you can't build all of them, build them individually.  
      </p>
      <subsection name="Current Build Issues">
        <p>
          Depending on your version of Maven, you may have various problems with
          the reports being generated, or you may run out of memory when you do a
          complete build.  One approach to take is to turn off running unit tests
      <source><![CDATA[
    $  mvn site -DskipTests=true
   ]]></source>
         and/or excluding various components:
         </p>   
       <source><![CDATA[
    $  mvn -pl parser,crypto site
    ]]></source>
