    <section name="Building Fulcrum">
      <p>
        Building Fulcrum from SVN is now very easy because it has been
        Maven-enabled.  Before you begin, you'll need to check out the
        <code>turbine-fulcrum</code> SVN repository (if you are
        not familiar with the Apache SVN repositories, please refer to
        the <a href="http://apache.org/dev/version-control.html">documentation</a>).
      </p>
    <h4>Maven 2 Build</h4>
      <p>
        Please refer to the Maven 2/3 <a
        href="http://maven.apache.org/guides/getting-started/">Getting
        Started</a> document for instructions on how to install and
        use Maven.
      </p>
      <p>
        From the root directory of the Fulcrum project (where you checked
        out the code to or unpacked a source distribution), simply type 'mvn install'
        and press enter.  This will start a process that will
        build each component.  After the component is built, it will be
        installed into you local maven repository. 
       </p>
      <p>
       To build a local copy of the documentation, use 'mvn site'. 
       This will build a local copy of the web site in the 'target/site' directory. 
       Note, this uses a LOT of memory. If you can't build all of them, build them individually.  
      </p>
      <h4>Maven 1 Build</h4>
            <p>  
        For Maven 1 modules please refer to the Maven 1 <a
        href="http://maven.apache.org/maven-1.x/start/">Getting
        Started</a> documents.
        Building a Maven 1 component is done inside the component folder using 'maven fulcrum:build'. 
      </p>
       <subsection name="Current Build Issues">
        <p>
          <strong>Missing JARS!</strong>  There are some jar files that you must manually
          install due to licensing restrictions.  Javamail.jar will need to be downloaded.
          Note, when you download it from Sun's site, you will need to rename it from mail.jar
          to javamail-1.3.1.jar and place it in your MAVEN_REPO/javamail/jars/ directory.  You
          will also need to download jdbc-2.0.jar as well.  Lastly, for the Hibernate security
          provider, you need Sun's JTA jar file.  Currently, the easiest place to go is <a href="http://www.hibernate.org">
          Hibernate</a> and download the jar from there by downloading the current distribution.
        </p>
        <p>
          Depending on your version of Maven, you may have various problems with
          the reports being generated, or you may run out of memory when you do a
          complete build.  One approach to take is to turn off running unit tests
          and excluding various components:
         </p>
        <h4>Maven 2 Build</h4>
        <p>You could use the <strong>-pl (--projects)</strong> maven command line option. Yet another approach would be to use custom profile.
        </p>
        <source><![CDATA[
$ maven -pl parser,crypto site'
]]></source>
         <h4>Maven 1 Build</h4>
<source><![CDATA[
$ maven multiproject:site -Dmaven.test.skip=true -Dmaven.multiproject.excludes=security/*.*,cache/*.*,scheduler/*.*'
]]></source>
      </subsection>
      <subsection name="Maven Repositories">
        <p>
          If you are willing to build with an "unofficial" repository, you can uncomment
          the <code>maven.repo</code> property in the project.properties file.  This will
          allow Maven to download from a Turbine repository the various jars that are not
          currently in the main Maven repository.
