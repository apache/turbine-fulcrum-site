    <section name="Building Fulcrum">
      <p>
        Building Fulcrum from SVN is now very easy because it has been
        Maven-enabled.  Before you begin, you'll need to check out the
        <code>turbine-fulcrum</code> SVN repository (if you are
        not familiar with the Apache SVN repositories, please refer to
        the <a href="http://apache.org/dev/version-control.html">documentation</a>).
      </p>
    <h4>Maven 2 Build</h4>
      <p>
        Please refer to the Maven 2/3 <a
        href="http://maven.apache.org/guides/getting-started/">Getting
        Started</a> document for instructions on how to install and
        use Maven.
      </p>
      <p>
        From the root directory of the Fulcrum project (where you checked
        out the code to or unpacked a source distribution), simply type 'mvn install'
        and press enter.  This will start a process that will
        build each component.  After the component is built, it will be
        installed into you local maven repository. 
       </p>
      <p>
       To build a local copy of the documentation, use 'mvn site'. 
       This will build a local copy of the web site in the 'target/site' directory. 
       Note, this uses a LOT of memory. If you can't build all of them, build them individually.  
      </p>

        <p>
          Depending on your version of Maven, you may have various problems with
          the reports being generated, or you may run out of memory when you do a
          complete build.  One approach to take is to turn off running unit tests
          and excluding various components:
         </p>
        <h4>Maven 2 Build</h4>
        <p>You could use the <strong>-pl (--projects)</strong> maven command line option. Yet another approach would be to use custom profile.
