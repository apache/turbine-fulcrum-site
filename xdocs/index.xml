 <section name="What is Fulcrum?">
   <p>
     Fulcrum was originally created as part of the Turbine 3 effort.  The idea
     was to be able to decouple the services from Turbine 2 allowing them to be
     used on both projects.
   </p>
   <p>
     Fulcrum is currently evolving into a component repository based on the Avalon framework.
     Each service is being converted into a stand alone component that can
     be released independently of the other components.  This will allow the
     Turbine project to to release components as they change instead of having
     to release everything at once.  This will also allow other projects to take advantage
     of these components.
   </p>

 <section name="Container compatibility">
   <p>
     All components are compatible in Avalon's ECM container.  Any dependencies
     on other components, system properties, or context elements are clearly
     documented in the docs for each component.
   </p>
   <p>
    Additionally, Fulcrum offers the Yaafi component.  Yaafi (Yet Another Avalon Framework
    Implementation) is a very simple container that is meant to be used with singleton
    components.  It is perfect for unit testing your components.  You can then run them in
    any other Avalon container like ECM, Phoenix, Excaliber, etc..
